## Course Description

In this course, students build on knowledge of RESTful web patterns and dive deep into the Node and Express ecosystems. Students learn how to manage greater scope and complexity in their code while consistently keeping the user's experience in mind through implementing a clone of the popular website, Reddit. The course will also cover the procedures required to authenticate and authorize web application users.

## Prerequisites

1. [WEB 1.1](http://make.sc/web1.1)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to&hellip;

1. Diagram and implement resource associations using a document-based database.
1. Write advanced db queries with a focus on optimum performance and efficiency.
1. Discern between differing levels of persistence and the use cases that best fit each.
1. Implement authentication using JWT tokens and sessions.
1. Invent, create, test, deploy, and deliver a custom, fully secured API.

<!-- To best prepare for the final exam, review [this study guide](study-guide.md). -->

## Class Recordings

All class recordings for Dani's class will be available [here](https://bit.ly/droxey-vids) no later than 24 hours after the class session. For privacy reasons, please do not share the recordings outside of the ACS student body.

## Class Assignments

We will be using Gradescope this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at https://gradescope.com/reset_password. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.
